# xSprite-2D-animation-framework
xSprite was a 2D frame-based sprite animation framework for Microsoft XNA 4.0.  I created it back in 2012 for a game development meetup group.  

It was a great way to learn how 2D animation with sprites worked and it helped me learn C# while doing it.

I used xSprite as the sprite system for several small projects and it always did what I expected it to do.

The source code worked the last time I checked (probably back in 2012), but Microsoft's XNA is dead.  If you're seriously interested in using C# for game development, check out the Unity game engine at http://unity3d.com .  It's what I would use today.

I'm posting this as a portfolio sample for potential employers.
